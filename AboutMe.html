                Hello, I am supertutugood. I am the creator of this website thanks to my current programing skills.
                <br>Oh and I also draw stuff sometimes.

            Why make this website?
            <div class="sep"></div>
            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">
                Simply because I couldn't find a good social media platform to post my art on. <br>(Also because I can do whatever I want here like put a picture of spinning fries under this text)

            What video games do I play?
            <div class="sep"></div>
            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">
                I like to play all sort of games. <br>While mostly Nintendo/Mario games, I like to take a break and go for things like TF2 or some indie game.

            When did I start drawing?
            <div class="sep"></div>
            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">
                I started since young little me. But of course, those weren't the same kind of drawings that I do today. <br>
                I would say, about Mid-highschool I started focusing a lot more on getting a stable artstyle. Of course, this one changes a lot, but it's all for the better! (In my opinion)

            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">
                While I do use a all sort of software, it mostly comes down to these two: <br>
                <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita: It's free and a god send. <br></a>
